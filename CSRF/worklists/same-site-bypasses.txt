SameSite Lax
- Use top-level navigation via GET to include cookies
- Convert POST endpoint to GET with `_method=POST` if app supports method override
- Use 302/redirect chains initiated by attacker but ending on victim domain (if available)

SameSite Strict
- Find first-party client-side redirects that re-originate navigation (e.g., comment confirmation redirect)
- Abuse sibling/cms subdomains where cookies are valid and flows redirect back
- Require user interaction to open first-party auth window (OAuth refresh), then submit CSRF

General
- Ensure target endpoint accepts cookies on the final same-site navigation step
- Prefer GET-compatible endpoints or override patterns
