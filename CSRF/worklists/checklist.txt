Targets
- List all state-changing endpoints (profile, email, password, funds, role, delete, 2FA).
- Identify forms and AJAX calls; note method and content-type.

Session and cookies
- Is a session cookie required? What is SameSite (Strict/Lax/None)?
- Any helper cookies involved in CSRF (csrfKey/duplicate CSRF)?

Protections
- CSRF token present? Hidden field, header, meta? Required on server?
- Token properties: per-request? session-bound? user-bound? reusable?
- Double-submit cookie used? Is equality the only check?
- Origin/Referer validated? Strict host match? Presence-only? Substring?
- Custom header requirement (X-Requested-With) or JSON-only?

Behavior tests
- Remove token → still works?
- Reuse token → works multiple times?
- Cross-user token → works for another user?
- Mismatch double-submit → blocked?
- Remove Referer (meta no-referrer) → still accepted?
- Force unsafe-url Referer and pad query → accepted?
- Top-level GET navigation with Lax → works?
- `_method=POST` accepted on GET → works?
- Cookie CRLF seed possible on any endpoint → seed then submit works?
- OAuth refresh or in-app redirect re-origination available?
- WebSocket Origin missing/weak → CSWSH viable?
